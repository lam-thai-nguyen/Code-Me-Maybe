\section{What a document class does}
The document class sets up the general layout of the document, for example

\begin{itemize}
    \item design: margins, fonts, spacing, etc.
    \item whether chapters are available
    \item if the title should be on a separate page
\end{itemize}

\section{The base classes}
LaTeX is supplied with a set of standard classes, all of which look similar but with some variations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{article}: short documents without chapters
    \item \texttt{report}: longer documents with chapters, single-sided printing
    \item \texttt{book}: longer documents with chapters, double-sided printing, with front- and back-matter (for example an index)
    \item \texttt{letter}: correspondence with no sections
    \item \texttt{slides}: for presentations (but see below)
\end{itemize}

The standard article, report and book classes take the options 10pt, 11pt and 12pt to change font size, and twocolumn to make a two-column document.
